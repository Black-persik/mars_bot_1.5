# Quality Attribute Scenarios

## Performance Efficiency

### Importance
The support bot must quickly answer user questions, even during peak load hours. 

#### 1) Concurrent Users Load

| Attribute           | Performance Efficiency                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Source**          | Multiple simultaneous users             |
| **Stimulus**        | 200 concurrent users ask questions at one time |
| **Artifact**        | MARS Bot handling requests              |
| **Environment**     | Production environment during peak usage period |
| **Response**        | The system processes all questions without significant delay and maintains responsiveness |
| **Response Measure**| Average response time for bot's answer is under 10 seconds, with no timeouts or failures |


Test: 
Perform load testing â€” simulate 200 simultaneous requests to the bot and measure the average response time and error rate.

#### 2) Performance Efficiency: Time-behavior

#### Importance
The user should receive a response almost instantly.

| Attribute           | Performance Efficiency: Time-behavior    |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Source**          | User                                    |
| **Stimulus**        | User sends a question to the bot         |
| **Artifact**        | MARS Bot                                 |
| **Environment**     | Production                               |
| **Response**        | Bot provides an answer to the user       |
| **Response Measure**| 95% of responses are delivered within 5 seconds |

 Test:  
 Use logging to measure latency for each request, build a graph, and make sure that 95% fit within 5 seconds.

#### 3) Functional Suitability: Functional Correctness

#### Importance
The user should receive relevant and correct answers. Any incorrect or "broken" answer reduces the credibility of the system.


| Attribute           | Functional Suitability: Functional Correctness |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Source**          | User                                         |
| **Stimulus**        | User asks a supported question to the bot    |
| **Artifact**        | MARS Bot                                     |
| **Environment**     | Production                                   |
| **Response**        | Bot provides the correct and expected answer |
| **Response Measure**| At least 98% of test questions (from the reference set) are answered correctly |

Test:  
Create a test set of question-answers and run these questions through the bot, calculate the percentage of correct answers.
