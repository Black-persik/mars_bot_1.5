# Continuous Delivery (CD)

The project implements an automatic deployment using the [Railway] service(https://railway.app /).

## How it works

After each commit to the main branch:
- Railway automatically pulls changes from GitHub
- Reassembles the environment
- Deploys an updated version of the project on the server

## Deployment Steps:

1. Connecting the GitHub repository to Railway
2. Selecting a project to deploy (`Deploy from GitHub repo')
3. Configuring environment variables (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN', `WEBHOOK_URL')
4. Setting the public address and webhooks
5. Viewing logs and successful deployment
