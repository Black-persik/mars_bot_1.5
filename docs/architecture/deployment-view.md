Our server system is deployed on the Railway server.

To simplify integration with the customer's application, we provide documented API endpoints. The client can connect directly to these endpoints from their own application, making it easier to implement our server functions without having to change the existing interface or infrastructure.

**Deployment Highlights:**

**Server:** Railway _(cloud server)_

**Integration:** The customer is provided with secure API endpoints to connect his application to our server.
